# Inline Countdown

An Obsidian plugin that displays inline countdowns and countups for date links in preview mode.

## Features

- Detects date links in the format `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]`
- Detects Tasks plugin due dates in the format `ðŸ“… YYYY-MM-DD`
- In [live preview](https://help.obsidian.md/edit-and-read#Live+Preview), shows live countdown timers for future dates
- Shows countups for dates in the past
